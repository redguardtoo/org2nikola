* Install
Download org2nikola.el and put it somewhere, say "~/.emacs.d/lisp/nikola".

Insert below code into ~/.emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/nikola")
(require 'org2nikola)
;; OPTIONAL, set the root directory of nikola
;; "~/.config/nikola/posts" contains the *.meta and *.wp
(setq org2nikola-output-root-directory "~/.config/nikola")
#+END_SRC
* Usage
** Render HTML
Say I got a org file with following content:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
 * article 1
   blah
 * article 2
   blah blah
#+END_SRC

Put focus in inside of subtree "article 2" and =M-x org2nikola-export-subtree=. That's it.

Org2nikola output files into "~/.config/nikola". You need run =cd ~/.config/nikola && nikola build= to render website.

You need run =M-x org2nikola-rerender-published-posts= once when you switch computer to publish blog.
** Tag the post
It's =org-mode= feature. Press =C-c C-c= or =M-x org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c=.
** Re-render all published posts
Run =M-x org2nikola-rerender-published-posts=.

Please provide the directory containing org files if it's not set in =org2nikola-org-blog-directory=.

* Nikola setup
Check my [[https://gist.github.com/redguardtoo/d6ded55e050343b4629b#file-conf-py][conf.py]]. [[http://www.google.com.au/analytics/][Google Analytics]] and [[https://highlightjs.org/][hightlight.js (syntax highlight JS library)]] is used.

If you are a newbie of Nikola or you need import post from wordpress, check [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/migrate-blog-from-wordpress-into-nikola.html][this guide]].

You may =(setq org2nikola-use-verbose-metadata t)= because more verbose meta data format is suggested by nikola 7.7+.
* Tips
** Customize html output
You can use =org2nikola-process-output-html-function= to customize the html,
#+begin_src elisp
(defun my-customize-post-content (html title post-slug)
  (ignore title post-slug)
  html)
(setq org2nikola-process-output-html-function 'my-customize-post-content)
#+end_src
** Upload HTML (OPTIONAL)
You can always upload HTML files *manually* to the web server. Org2nikola provides =org2nikola-after-hook= for automation.
*** GitHub Pages
Here is the sample setup:
#+begin_src elisp
(defun org2nikola-after-hook-setup (title slug)
  "see https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/ for setup
 run `ln -s ~/projs/redguardtoo.github.io ~/.config/nikola/output`, btw"
  (let* ((url (concat "http://blog.binchen.org/posts/" slug ".html"))
         (nikola-dir (file-truename "~/.config/nikola"))
         (cmd "cd ~/projs/redguardtoo.github.io && git add . && git commit -m updated && git push origin master"))
    ;; copy the blog url into kill-ring
    (kill-new url)
    (message "%s => kill-ring" url)
    ;; nikola is building posts ...
    (shell-command (format "cd %s; nikola build" nikola-dir))
    (shell-command cmd)))

(add-hook 'org2nikola-after-hook 'org2nikola-after-hook-setup)
#+end_src

Please note my user name at github is "redguardtoo" and my blog domain is "blog.binchen.org". You need replace them with your own stuff.
*** FTP
Here is the setup:
#+begin_src elisp
(defun org2nikola-after-hook-setup (title slug)
  (let* ((url (concat "http://blog.yourdomain.net/posts/" slug ".html"))
         (nikola-dir (file-truename "~/.config/nikola"))
         (lines (split-string (shell-command-to-string (format "cd %s; nikola build" nikola-dir)) "\n")))
    (kill-new url)
    (message "%s => kill-ring" url)
    (dolist (l lines)
      (when (string-match "output\\(.*/\\)*\\([^/]*\\)$" l)
        (let* ((dir (match-string 1 l))
               (file (match-string 2 l))
               (cmd (format "ncftpput -b -u %s -p %s ftp.yourdomain.net /blog%s %s/output%s%s"
                            "yourusername"
                            "yourpassword"
                            dir
                            nikola-dir
                            dir
                            file)))
          (shell-command cmd))))))

(add-hook 'org2nikola-after-hook 'org2nikola-after-hook-setup)
#+end_src

You need install [[http://www.ncftp.com/][ncftp]] which is the FTP client. See [[http://blog.binchen.org/posts/how-to-publish-static-html-blog-in-emacs-as-a-programmer.html][How a programmer publish static HTML blog in Emacs]] for details.
